# 🧠 Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Playground** — a personal space where I explore, implement, and document my journey through machine learning concepts and hands-on projects.

## 🚀 What's in this repo?

- 📓 **Notes** on ML theory, concepts, and intuition
- 🔢 **From-scratch implementations** of popular ML algorithms
- 📊 **Mini-projects** using real datasets
- 📁 Clean directory structure to keep things organized
